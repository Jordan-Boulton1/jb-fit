## Code Validation

### HTML

I have used the recommended [HTML W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org) to validate all of my HTML files.

| Directory | File | Screenshot | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| about | about.html | ![screenshot](documentation/testing/validation/html/html-validation-about.png) | Pass: No Errors |
| accounts | add_weight_log.html | ![screenshot](documentation/testing/validation/html/html-validation-add-weight-log.png) | Pass: No Errors |
| accounts | edit_profile.html | ![screenshot](documentation/testing/validation/html/html-validation-profile-edit.png) | Pass: No Errors |
| accounts | edit_weight_log.html | ![screenshot](documentation/testing/validation/html/html-validation-edit-weight-log.png) | Pass: No Errors |
| accounts | profile.html | ![screenshot](documentation/testing/validation/html/html-validation-profile.png) | Pass: No Errors |
| accounts | signup.html | ![screenshot](documentation/testing/validation/html/html-validation-signup.png) | I am aware of this error from the validator and is happening due to allauth. I have attempted to remove the `aria-describedby` in the signup form however I was unable to fix it for that reason error will still show up in the validator. |
| checkout | checkout.html | ![screenshot](documentation/testing/validation/html/html-validation-checkout.png) | Pass: No Errors |
| checkout | checkout_success.html | ![screenshot](documentation/testing/validation/html/html-validation-checkout-success.png) | Pass: No Errors |
| contact | contact_form.html | ![screenshot](documentation/testing/validation/html/html-validation-home.png) | Pass: No Errors - Contact form is on every page. |
| faq | faq.html | ![screenshot](documentation/testing/validation/html/html-validation-faq.png) | Pass: No Errors |
| home | home.html | ![screenshot](documentation/testing/validation/html/html-validation-home.png) | Pass: No Errors |
| plans | plans.html | ![screenshot](documentation/testing/validation/html/html-validation-plans.png) | Pass: No Errors |
| | logout.html | ![screenshot](documentation/testing/validation/html/html-validation-logout.png) | Pass: No Errors |
| | login.html | ![screenshot](documentation/testing/validation/html/html-validation-login.png) | Pass: No Errors |
| | password_reset.html | ![screenshot](documentation/testing/validation/html/html-validation-password-reset.png) | Pass: No Errors |
| | password_reset_done.html | ![screenshot](documentation/testing/validation/html/html-validation-password-reset-done.png) | Pass: No Errors |

### CSS

I have used the recommended [CSS Jigsaw Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator) to validate all of my CSS files.

| Directory | File | Screenshot | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| accounts | profile.css | ![screenshot](documentation/testing/validation/css/css-validation-profile.png) | Pass: No Errors |
| checkout | checkout.css | ![screenshot](documentation/testing/validation/css/css-validation-checkout.png) | Pass: No Errors |
| plans | plans.css | ![screenshot](documentation/testing/validation/css/css-validation-plans.png) | Pass: No Errors |
| static | base.css | ![screenshot](documentation/testing/validation/css/css-validation-base.png) | Pass: No Errors |


### JavaScript

I have used the recommended [JShint Validator](https://jshint.com) to validate all of my JS files.


| Directory | File | Screenshot | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| accounts/js | edit_profile.js | ![screenshot](documentation/testing/validation/javascript/edit-profile-validation.png) | |
| accounts/js | profile.js | ![screenshot](documentation/testing/validation/javascript/profile-validation.png) | `myChart` ***on line 39***: Although flagged as unused, `myChart` is actually used when creating the chart, and while it's not directly interacted with after its creation, it serves the purpose of initializing the chart in the DOM. This variable is required to properly display the chart but doesn't need to be referenced again unless you plan to manipulate the chart later (e.g., update data, destroy the chart). JSHint’s warning is just a result of it not seeing further use in the scope.  `editWeightLog` ***on line 112***: This function is defined but not directly called in the script file; however, it's used as an event handler for dynamically generated DOM elements. Specifically, it's assigned to the "Edit" button for each row in the weight logs table. The function needs to be accessible in the global scope because the buttons are dynamically inserted into the DOM, and the event listeners are set directly in the HTML generated by JavaScript.  `deleteWeightLog` ***on line 156***: Similar to `editWeightLog`, the `deleteWeightLog` function is used as an event handler for dynamically created "Delete" buttons in the table. These buttons are generated when the `loadLogHistory` function runs, and each button calls this function when clicked. JSHint flags it because it doesn't see the call within the script, but it’s actually called via the dynamically generated elements. |

### Python

I have used the recommended [PEP8 CI Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com) to validate all of my Python files.

## Automated Testing

I have conducted a series of automated tests on my application.

I fully acknowledge and understand that, in a real-world scenario, an extensive set of additional tests would be more comprehensive.

### Python (Unit Testing)
I have used Django's built-in unit testing framework to test the application functionality.

In order to run the tests, I ran the following command in the terminal each time:

`python manage.py test`

To create the coverage report, I would then run the following commands:

`coverage run manage.py test`

`coverage report`

To see the HTML version of the reports, and find out whether some pieces of code were missing, I ran the following commands:

`coverage html`

`python -m http.server`

Below are the results from the various apps on my application that I've tested:
| App | File | Coverage | Screenshot                                                                                   |

## JavaScript (Jest Testing)
During the implementation of unit testing using Jest, I encountered several challenges, primarily due to extensive DOM manipulation by third-party libraries such as Chart.js and Stripe. Mocking Chart.js proved particularly challenging, leading to multiple obstacles that prevented precise testing. As a result, I had to resort to more generalized assertions to verify that data was correctly loaded into the chart.

Stubbing Stripe was another complex task that presented significant difficulties, and as a result, I was unable to fully unit test the associated script. Additionally, several other third-party services required mocking, which was handled with the help of jest.setup.js.

To run the tests, it is necessary to execute the command npm install to install all the required packages needed for compiling and running the tests. Tests can then be executed using the command npm test, and to obtain coverage reports, the command npm test --coverage should be used.

Below are the coverage results and successful test runs generated during the testing process:

| Test Suites | Tests | Screenshot                                                      |
