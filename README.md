## UX


When designing this webpage I wanted to achieve a simple, yet welcoming and professional feeling, creating a nice user experience.

### Colour Scheme

The colour scheme for the JB Fit website has been thoughtfully selected to create a visually appealing and effective user experience.

- `#FFFFFF` & `#000000` used interchangeably for primary text and headings.
- `#FF5100` used for primary highlights.
- `#f5f5f5` used as the  primary background colour.
- `#353431` used as the secondary background colour, primarily in the navbar and footer.

I used [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/ffffff-f5f5f5-ff5100-353431-000000) to generate my colour palette.

I've used CSS `:root` variables to easily update the global colour scheme by changing only one value, instead of everywhere in the CSS file.

```css
:root {
--primary-color: #353431;
--primary-color-highlight: #FF5100;
/* Bootstrap overrides */
--bs-body-bg: #f5f5f5;
--bs-body-font-family: 'Cambay', sans-serif;
```

### Typography

- [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat) was used for the primary headers and titles.

- [Mukta](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Mukta) was used for the secondary headers and titles.

- [Cambay](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Cambay) was used for all other secondary text.

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) icons were used throughout the site, such as the social media icons in the footer.
