## UX


When designing this webpage I wanted to achieve a simple, yet welcoming and professional feeling, creating a nice user experience.

### Colour Scheme

The colour scheme for the JB Fit website has been thoughtfully selected to create a visually appealing and effective user experience.

- `#FFFFFF` & `#000000` used interchangeably for primary text and headings.
- `#FF5100` used for primary highlights.
- `#f5f5f5` used as the  primary background colour.
- `#353431` used as the secondary background colour, primarily in the navbar and footer.

I used [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/ffffff-f5f5f5-ff5100-353431-000000) to generate my colour palette.

![screenshot](documentation/coolors.png)

I've used CSS `:root` variables to easily update the global colour scheme by changing only one value, instead of everywhere in the CSS file.

```css
:root {
--primary-color: #353431;
--primary-color-highlight: #FF5100;
/* Bootstrap overrides */
--bs-body-bg: #f5f5f5;
--bs-body-font-family: 'Cambay', sans-serif;
```

### Typography

- [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat) was used for the primary headers and titles.

- [Mukta](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Mukta) was used for the secondary headers and titles.

- [Cambay](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Cambay) was used for all other secondary text.

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) icons were used throughout the site, such as the social media icons in the footer.

## Database Design

Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERD) help to visualize database architecture before creating models.
Understanding the relationships between different tables can save time later in the project.

```mermaid
erDiagram
User ||--o{ TrainingPlan : fk_User_TrainingPlan
User ||--|{ Checkout : fk_User_Checkout
User ||--o{ WeightLog : fk_User_WeightLog
User ||--o{ ProgressImage : fk_User_ProgressImage
TrainingPlan ||--|{ Checkout : fk_TrainingPlan_Checkout


User {
  int id  PK
  varchar(50) first_name
  varchar(50) last_name
  varchar(255) email
  varchar(100) password
  varchar(30) phone_number
  varchar(100) address
  varchar(255) image
  int gender
  datetime date_of_birth
  decimal current_weight
  decimal height
  decimal goal_weight
  int training_plan_id  FK  "NULL"
}

TrainingPlan {
  int id  PK
  varchar(150) title
  text description
  decimal price
}

WeightLog {
  int id  PK
  int user_id  FK
  decimal weight
  datetime entry_date
}

ProgressImage {
  int id  PK
  int user_id  FK
  varchar(255) image
  dateTime entry_date
}

Checkout {
  int id  PK
  int user_id  FK
  int training_plan_id  FK
  decimal total
}

Newsletter {
  varchar(255) email
}

Contact {
  varchar(50) first_name
  varchar(50) last_name
  varchar(255) email
  text message
}
```

I have used [mermaidchart](https://www.mermaidchart.com/) to generate an ERD.

## Agile Development Process

### GitHub Projects

[GitHub Projects](https://github.com/Jordan-Boulton1/jb-fit/projects?query=is%3Aopen) served as an Agile tool for this project.
It isn't a specialized tool, but with the right tags and project creation/issue assignments, it can be made to work.

Through it, user stories, issues, and milestone tasks were planned, then tracked on a weekly basis using the basic Kanban board.

![screenshot](documentation/projects-board.png)

### GitHub Issues

[GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Jordan-Boulton1/peak-performance/issues) served as an another Agile tool.
There, I used my own **User Story Template** to manage user stories.

It also helped with milestone iterations on a weekly basis.

### MoSCoW Prioritization

I've decomposed my Epics into stories prior to prioritizing and implementing them.
Using this approach, I was able to apply the MoSCow prioritization and labels to my user stories within the Issues tab.

- **Must Have**: guaranteed to be delivered (*max 60% of stories*)
- **Should Have**: adds significant value, but not vital (*the rest ~20% of stories*)
- **Could Have**: has small impact if left out (*20% of stories*)
- **Won't Have**: not a priority for this iteration

### Milestones

To achieve success in the implementation of this project, I have setup milestones for the end of each week, which represented my "sprints". My approach to solving the business problem in the domain area was to do vertical slicing of the system, instead of horizontal - an approach that I have used so far in my projects. Vertical slicing focuses on ensuring that at the end of each sprint you are able to produce something in the system that is deployable, worthy of a "demo", and that is useable by the client.
